# Pan Module
For the pan module I was trying multiple approaches (F.e. "Pulleys with a strip or Nema23 alone"). The problem was, that the components became to huge.
In the end I found a really simple way. It's a direct connection between the Motor (Nema17 with a planetary gearbox) and a Mengs DM-60 Base. I've designed my own motor mount plate.

I'm using here an additional Mengs FNR-140 to center the nodal point of the camera lens in the rotation axis.

I've chosen here an Nema17 with 1.8Â° per Full Step together with a 27:1 Gearbox

I can't promise that this list is complete

* Nema17 1.8degree (max 2.0A) 27:1 Gearbox (check the max length!)
* Motor Coupling Fixed Version! 
* Spacers (40mm) (4x)
* Center Screw M8 (1x)
* Mengs DM-60 (1x)
* Mengs PU-70 (1x)
* iShoot QS-120 (1x)
* 16x8x5 Radial Flanged Bearing (688ZZ Flanged) (2x)
* 16x8x5 Axial Bearing (Silber/Gold) (2x)
+ M8 Nut (DIN 439) Thin Version (1x)
* Washers & Screws
  * 12x8 Washer
  * Screws (M5)

## Assembly
Cut the M5 thread in the Camera Base Plate & Motor Pan Plate
Connect all part like on the images below.

The stack will look like that:

![alt text](https://github.com/JoJ123/Camera-Motion-Slider/blob/master/Hardware/2%20Pan%20Module/images/Pan1.png?raw=true)
- Red is the 16x8x5 Axial Bearing
- Green is the 688ZZ Flanged
- Gray is a 12x8 Washer
- Ignore the flexible motor coupling, it must be a fixed one here!
- I've used a flanged screw from the top to the bottom. Starting from the Mengs DN-60 that is fixed on top of the camera plate.


## Pan Module Image
You can also use the pan module directly on a tripod, as the base for an panorma image.
