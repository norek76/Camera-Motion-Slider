# Base with Pan

The base for the slider was build from parts available under the "OpenBuild" Brands. I was ordering my stuff from a seller in Portugal, that is shipping to Germany. Some parts like the Motor Mount Plate is a bit different in their store. The following list is build from the parts available at this seller.
Some other parts like motors, ... were ordered by ebay.

I've chosen here an Nema23 with 1.8Â°/Full Step
The Lead Screw will move the slider 8mm with one rotation.

## Motor Connection
I'm using M12 Sensor Connector. I got a few of them for a good price, but you can use mostly any connector that is available. The good thing about this M12 Sensor Plugs is, that there is also a lot of different extension cables available.
